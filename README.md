# Telangana-Tourism-Data-Analysis
Designed and developed Revenue/Municipal Admin Dashboard for Telangana Govt. Tourism Dept. Used Power BI to analyze tourism data, provide data-driven recommendations, optimize operations, boost revenue, and drive strategic decisions.

## Problem Statement
Telangana is one of India’s leading states and has published its tourism data under its open data policy.

As a data analyst, Peter Pandey saw this as an opportunity to expand his skills and show his work on a bigger scale. Peter Pandey’s idea is to find the patterns in the given data, do additional research, and give data-informed recommendations to the Telangana government which can be used to increase their revenue by improving administrative operations.
 
Peter began his work by framing some primary, and secondary research questions and recommendation ideas.

## Task
Imagine yourself as Peter Pandey and perform the following task:

•	Check ‘research_questions_and_recommendations.pdf’. You can use any tool of your choice (Python, SQL, PowerBI, Tableau, Excel, PowerPoint) to analyze and answer these questions. More relevant instructions are provided in this document.

•	The target audience is top-level officials - hence you need to create a convincing presentation to provide insights/recommendations.

•	You can add more research questions and answer them in your presentation that suits your recommendations.

•	Be creative with your presentation, audio/video presentation will have more weightage.

•	You can use additional data based on your own research to support your recommendations

## Credits
